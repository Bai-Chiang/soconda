  summary: RADICAL-Pilot is a pilot-based runtime system
  description: |
    RADICAL-Pilot (RP) is a flexible pilot-based system that provides a simple
    and scalable approach for executing many concurrent simulations and their
    data requirements on high performance computing (HPC) platforms. RP
    separates resource acquisition from using those resources to execute
    application tasks.
