# Simons Observatory Conda Tools

[This git repository](https://github.com/simonsobs/soconda) contains scripts to
help with:

- Installing a conda base system (optional)

- Creating a conda environment with a well-defined set of conda and pip packages

- Building a few legacy compiled packages into this environment

- Creating a versioned modulefile for loading the environment

The documentation also covers different user scenarios for loading and
customizing a pre-installed environment.
